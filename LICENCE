    The Mizumoto Public Licence is a free, copyleft licence for software
and other kinds of works. For countries that do not recognize copyleft,
this license means that the creator has "All Rights Reserved" for all the
codes,compiled binary files and other files governed by this Licence.

    The Mizumoto Public Licence is at first designed to guarantee my right
to make sure my codes are used for the correct purpose only. I, Mizumoto Ju,
will use this Licence for most of my future projects; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its creators. You can apply it to your
projects, too.

    All files in projects this Licence applies to, if they are originally
created by or have been modified by the project owner, can be shared under
Mozilla Public License 2.0, with extra restrictions. For any statement
in the Mozilla Public License 2.0 licence, if it conflicts with this file
(Mizumoto Public Licence Version 1.0), then the one in this file (Mizumoto
Public Licence Version 1.0) has higher priority.

    This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.
