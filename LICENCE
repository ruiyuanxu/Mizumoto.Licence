    The Mizumoto General Public Licence is a free, copyleft licence for
software and other kinds of works.

    The Mizumoro General Public Licence is designed to guarantee my right
to make sure my codes are used for the correct purpose only. I, Mizumoto Ju,
will use this Licence for most of my future projects; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your
projects, too.

    All files in projects this Licence applies to, if they are originally
created by or have been modified by the project owner
